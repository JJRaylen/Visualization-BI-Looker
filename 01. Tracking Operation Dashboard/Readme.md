Business Issues -
Historically, it has taken two analysts a week to prepare the reports for the quarterly board meetings. Also, there is usually at least one issue each quarter where a value in a report is wrong because of a bad cell reference in an Excel formula. On occasion, there are conflicting results in the reports because the products and departments that roll up to each business unit are not defined consistently.

Planned Changes -
Contoso plans to automate and standardize the quarterly reporting process by using Power BI. The company wants to reduce how long it takes to populate the reports to less than two days. The company wants to create common logic for the business units, products, and departments. The logic will be used across all reports, including but not limited to the quarterly reporting for the board.
Technical Requirements -
Contoso wants the reports and datasets refreshed with minimum manual effort.
The company wants to provide the board with a single package of reports that will contain custom navigation and links to supplementary information.
Maintenance, including manually updating data and access, must be minimized as much as possible.

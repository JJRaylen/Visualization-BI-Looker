Business Issues

Historically, it has taken 1 day to consolidate data and convert into valid report.This process actually encounters many problems related to data synchronization, data format errors causing delays in data processing, storage and reporting.


Planned Changes
Contoso plans to automate and standardize the quarterly reporting process by using Power BI. The company wants to reduce how long it takes to populate the reports to less than two days. The company wants to create common logic for the business units, products, and departments. The logic will be used across all reports, including but not limited to the quarterly reporting for the board.
Technical Requirements

Contoso wants the reports and datasets refreshed with minimum manual effort.
The company wants to provide the board with a single package of reports that will contain custom navigation and links to supplementary information.
Maintenance, including manually updating data and access, must be minimized as much as possible.
